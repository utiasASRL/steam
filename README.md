# steam

STEAM (Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Mapping) Engine is an optimization library aimed at solving batch nonlinear optimization problems involving both SO(3)/SE(3), SO(2)/SE(2), and continuous-time components. This is accomplished by using an iterative Gauss-Newton-style estimator in combination with techniques developed and used by ASRL. With respect to SO(2)/SO(3) and SE(2)/SE(3) components, we make use of the constraint sensitive perturbation schemes discussed in Barfoot and Furgale [1]. STEAM Engine is by no means intended to be the fastest car on the track; the intent is simply to be fast enough for the types of problems we wish to solve, while being both readable and easy to use by people with a basic background in robotic state estimation.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Compiler with C++17 support and OpenMP
- CMake (>=3.16)
- Eigen (>=3.3.7)
- [lgmath (>=1.1.0)](https://github.com/utiasASRL/lgmath.git)
- (Optional) ROS2 Foxy or later (colcon+ament_cmake)

### Install c++ compiler, cmake, OpenMP, and yaml support

```bash
sudo apt -q -y install build-essential cmake libomp-dev libyaml-cpp-dev
```

### Install Eigen (>=3.3.7)

```bash
# using APT
sudo apt -q -y install libeigen3-dev

# OR from source
WORKSPACE=~/workspace  # choose your own workspace directory
mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/eigen && cd $_
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git . && git checkout 3.3.7
mkdir build && cd $_
cmake .. && make install # default install location is /usr/local/
```

- Note: if installed from source to a custom location then make sure `cmake` can find it.

### Install lgmath

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/utiasASRL/lgmath.git).

### Build and install steam using `cmake`

```bash
WORKSPACE=~/workspace  # choose your own workspace directory
# clone
mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/steam && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/utiasASRL/steam.git .
# build and install
mkdir -p build && cd $_
cmake .. # optionally include -DBUILD_TESTING=ON to build tests
cmake --build .
cmake --install . # (optional) install, default location is /usr/local/
```

Preprocessor macros

- `STEAM_DEFAULT_NUM_OPENMP_THREADS=<num. threads>`: Default to 4. Define number of threads to be used by OpenMP in STEAM.
- `STEAM_USE_OBJECT_POOL`: Default to undefined. If defined then STEAM will use an object pool to improve performance but is no longer thread safe.

Note: `steamConfig.cmake` will be generated in both `build/` and `<install prefix>/lib/cmake/steam/` to be included in other projects.

### Build examples

[samples/CMakeLists.txt](./samples/CMakeLists.txt) shows an example of how to add steam to your projects.

To build and run these samples:

```bash
cd ${WORKSPACE}/steam  ## $WORKSPACE defined above
mkdir -p build_samples && cd $_
cmake ../samples
cmake --build .  # Executables will be generated in build_samples
```

### Build and install steam using `ROS2(colcon+ament_cmake)`

CMake will automatically determine if you are building as part of a colcon build command.

```bash
WORKSPACE=~/workspace  # choose your own workspace directory

mkdir -p ${WORKSPACE}/steam && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/utiasASRL/steam.git .

source <your ROS2 worspace that includes steam>
colcon build
```

Same preprocessor macro mentioned above also apply.
